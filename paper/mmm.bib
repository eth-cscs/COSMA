abstract="Intel Xeon Phi is a recently released high-performance coprocessor which features 61 cores each supporting 4 hardware threads with 512-bit wide SIMD registers achieving a peak theoretical performance of 1Tflop/s in double precision. Its design differs from classical modern processors; it comes with a large number of cores, the 4-way hyperthreading capability allows many applications to saturate the massive memory bandwidth, and its large SIMD capabilities allow to reach high computation throughput. The core of many scientific applications involves the multiplication of a large, sparse matrix with a single or multiple dense vectors which are not compute-bound but memory-bound. In this paper, we investigate the performance of the Xeon Phi coprocessor for these sparse linear algebra kernels. We highlight the important hardware details and show that Xeon Phi's sparse kernel performance is very promising and even better than that of cutting-edge CPUs and GPUs.",

Affine transformations in this model capture a complex sequence of execution-reordering loop transformations that can improve performance by parallelization as well as locality enhancement. Although a significant body of research has addressed affine scheduling and partitioning, the problem of automatically finding good affine transforms for communication-optimized coarse-grained parallelization together with locality optimization for the general case of arbitrarily-nested loop sequences remains a challenging problem.",

abstract="The first fit decreasing (FFD) heuristic algorithm is one of the most famous and most studied methods for an approximative solution of the bin-packing problem. For a listL, let OPT(L) denote the minimal number of bins into whichL can be packed, and let FFD(L) denote the number of bins used by FFD. Johnson[1] showed that for every listL, FFD(L)≤11/9OPT(L)+4. His proof required more than 100 pages. Later, Baker[2] gave a much shorter and simpler proof for FFD(L)≤11/9 OPT(L)+3. His proof required 22 pages. In this paper, we give a proof for FFD(L)≤11/9 OPT(L)+1. The proof is much simpler than the previous ones.",

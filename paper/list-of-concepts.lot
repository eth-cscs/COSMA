\contentsline {table}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces The formal summary of 2D, 2.5D, CARMA, and COMM schemes for matrix-matrix multiplication (The 3D decomposition is a special case of 2.5D, where $c=p^{1/3}$). The most important symbols used here are described in Table\nonbreakingspace \ref {tab:symbols}. The "easiest case" is when the matrices are square and there is no extra memory for redundant copies of input data. The "hardest case" is when $k \gg m = n$ and there is space for extra $p^{1/3}$ copies. For simplicity, we assume that parameters are chosen such that all divisions have integer results.\relax }}{16}{table.caption.11}

We assume that all the respective local domain sizes divide the global matrix sizes evenly (e.g., for cubic domain in range $p \le mn/S$, we assume that $\sqrt {S/3} = a_1M = a_2N = a_3K$ for $a_1, a_2, a_3 \in \mathbb {N}$). The optimal schedule (\cref {sec:parScheduling}) switches from \textbf {par. in ijk} to \textbf {cubic} when $p \ge \frac {mnk}{S^{3/2}}$.\relax }}{18}{table.caption.13}
